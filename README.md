gnome color border
======================

Gnome shell extension that adds a colored border


Eventually this extension will enable qubes os to draw window borders in gnome. 

its based from a extension that shades inactive windows with the orginal plan being to replace the shader class with the RedBorderEffect class from the gnome inspector. 
After I have borders on inactive windows the plan is to apply to all windows
once thats done I will add other colors and then work up a scheme for the extension to get what the window border would have been in xfce and then add that color border.
