This is a gnome extension that makes use of lower level apis drawing very basic decorations by hitting clutter/mutter directly. But the title bar color is an imporant part of the overall theme and usability so this method was left for an approach that uses GTK.

I suspect if this approach needed to be used a global theme could be used to set all the window decorations to white and an effect could be overlayed on said decorations coloring them.
